# Azerg: A Web Application for Automated STIX Reports Generation from Cyber Threat Intelligence

## Project Description
Azerg is a web application designed to automate the generation of STIX (Structured Threat Information Expression) reports from cyber threat intelligence. The project leverages **large language models** to process and generate detailed reports, while integrating various components such as **graph databases**, **malware analysis reports**, and automated systems. Throughout the course of this project, I worked on building and enhancing multiple components, including the frontend, backend, and core systems, with a strong focus on **CI/CD pipelines** and production-level application development.


## Duties/Activities
As part of this project, I was responsible for:
- Designing a **web UI** for a command-line tool that extracts and generates STIX reports from cyber threat intelligence data.
- Building the **web UI** using **React** (or another suitable frontend framework) to ensure a user-friendly interface for interacting with the core tool.
- Developing a **query engine** using **Neo4j** graph database to handle the storage, management, and retrieval of structured threat data.
- Building a **backend API** that interacts with the core tool to facilitate data extraction, processing, and report generation.

## Required Skills
- **Frontend Frameworks**: Experience with **React**, **Vue**, **Flutter**, or other similar frameworks to develop modern web applications.
- **Web Application Knowledge**: A good understanding of how web applications work, including client-server communication.
- **System Design Knowledge**: Understanding the fundamentals of system design to handle scalability and reliability.
- **Concurrency & Web Sockets**: Familiarity with handling blocking and non-blocking behaviors, and using **web sockets** for real-time communication.
- Experience with **Neo4j** for graph database handling.


## Learning Opportunities
Throughout the project, I had the opportunity to:
- **System Design**: Implementing a system design for a production-level web application that involves multiple heavy-load tasks, including data extraction, report generation, and interaction with complex databases.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Gaining hands-on experience with **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** practices to automate build, testing, and deployment processes.
- **Git for Production**: Deepening my understanding of **Git** and version control in a professional, production-level environment, ensuring efficient collaboration and code management.

## Technologies Used:
- **Frontend**: React (or another suitable frontend framework)
- **Database**: Neo4j (Graph Database)
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
